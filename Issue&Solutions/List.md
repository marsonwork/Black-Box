# List of issues I encountered while setting up blackbox:

## Pi not rebooting with Argon Fan hat

So I am using argon fan hat along with waveshare ups hat(b). Sometimes I have noticed while being plugged in, rasberry pi does not boot up back after switch is pressed for reboot, or from a soft shutdonw.

It is not observered always. Many times it works perfectly.

### Solution: No possible solution as of now.

## OMV Not starting after Pi reboots:

So I have observed on 24th April 2022, that I restarted my pi, but could not log into OMV. The OMV page on IP address was not showing up. Since I have used OMV6, thought might be some glitches, then searched in forums a bit, and found few possible fixes for it, and the one worked for me was restarting browser, so it is not OMV issue. Here are list of fixes mentioned: https://forum.openmediavault.org/index.php?thread/21269-solutions-to-common-problems/
